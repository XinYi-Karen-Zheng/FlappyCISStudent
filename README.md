# Flappy CIS Student
The Flappy Bird game, with design changes to attract CIS students at Penn.
Flappy CIS Student mainly consists of the game itself and a leaderboard that persists between app restarts.


Before starting the game, user can choose between starting the game and going to the learderboard. The background is the curriculum requirements for CIS major at Penn.
